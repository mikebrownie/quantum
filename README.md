# quantum
Python3 and Numpy. Computational tools to help with quantum operations. 

## innerProduct

Showcases inner products in Dirac Notation (commonly used in QC). Examples include bell basis states and multi qbit states

## circuitMatrixHelper

Used to show how one can calculate the action of a circuit on a quantum state and represent it as a matrix

## nDimSpaces

Shows how one can construct n-dimensional spaces with the kronecker product of unitary spaces. Example showcase is with the HxH to create H_2
